### Project Description
This project analyzes customer satisfaction factors for Dano Airlines, focusing on identifying the elements that most impact passengers' experiences. Using data on customer feedback, this project provides insights to help Dano Airlines enhance service quality and overall customer satisfaction.

### Objective
The goal of this analysis is to reveal the main factors affecting customer satisfaction, with a focus on:
- Timeliness and delay management
- Booking and check-in convenience
- Quality of in-flight services and facility locations
- Key drivers of overall satisfaction

### Data Source
- **Source**: Customer feedback data provided by Dano Airlines (either publicly available or anonymized sample).
- **Size and Format**: The dataset is approximately `(number of rows)` records in `.csv` format.

### Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Addressed missing values and standardized data entries to ensure consistency.
2. **Data Modeling**: Defined relationships between key data fields such as customer type, satisfaction level, and service attributes. Created calculated measures to derive insights on delays, customer experience scores, and satisfaction metrics.
3. **Power BI Visualization**: Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize customer satisfaction trends across various variables and enable deeper exploration.

### Insights
The analysis provided several important findings about customer satisfaction factors for Dano Airlines:

1. **Timeliness and Delay Impact**:
   - **Business travelers** reported the highest dissatisfaction with **departure and arrival delays**, as they experienced the most extended total delays. This groupâ€™s satisfaction could improve with better on-time performance.

2. **Online Booking Convenience**:
   - **Ease of online booking** was rated lower, particularly among passengers traveling for **personal trips**. Improving the booking process for these customers could enhance their experience.

3. **In-Flight WiFi Service**:
   - **WiFi service** was rated poorly across all travel classes, indicating a consistent area for improvement in-flight amenities.

4. **Departure and Arrival Convenience**:
   - **Low convenience ratings** for both departure and arrival procedures led to a high level of overall inconvenience, impacting the customer experience negatively.

5. **Gender Neutrality in Satisfaction**:
   - Satisfaction levels showed **no significant variation based on gender**, suggesting that customer satisfaction factors were consistent across male and female passengers.

6. **In-Flight and Baggage Services**:
   - Areas such as **in-flight service quality** and **baggage handling** received mixed feedback, with room for further analysis and improvement.

7. **First-Time vs. Returning Customers**:
   - **First-time customers** tended to report lower satisfaction scores, particularly regarding their initial experiences. However, due to the relatively smaller proportion of first-time customers compared to returning ones, this factor did not majorly impact overall dissatisfaction levels.

These insights suggest areas where Dano Airlines can focus improvement efforts, particularly in timeliness, online booking experience, and WiFi service quality.
